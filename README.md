## Project proposal theme in a sentence
Segmentation and analysis applied to photos of bird droppings for quantitative morphological characterization

##  Abstract
Health conditions and sensibility to some kind of foods may affect the gastrointestinal tract of birds leading to changes in the morphology of its excrements (also called bird droppings).
The healthy dropping basically consist of two phases: a long cilindrical green solid shape imerse in a heterogeneous white and translucid liquid.
Some health conditions, like diarhea and bleeding, may disturb the usual morphology and color, while the quantity of ingested water and food may affect the area of the dropping.

In this project, I expect to process photos of _psittacidae_ droppings to extract information that will allow quantification of its morphology.
The information to be extracted was grouped in phases according to the expected difficulty of image processing:
a) total area, area of solid green phase, area of the white on liquid phase;
b) presence and intensity of red (indicative of blood);
c) presence of 'dots' from undigested food on the solid phase;
d) nÂº of segments of the solid part;
e) eventually other ones that may emerge during the development.

Photos will be taken personally by the student using a digital camera (DSLR raw, DSLR jpeg, new smartphone or old smartphone, whichever have potential for better results) with the dropping placed on a clean sheet of paper along a reference scale.
Some cases like (b) and (c) must use supplemented images from the internet, because the voluntary subject is healthy.
It is expected that those cases may be left out of this project if no good quality images could be found.

All measurements from healthy droppings will be gathered to compose a normality curve for the subject.

If time allows, a secondary objective of inspection of variances using ANOVA and a Design of Experiments scheme for the following treatments may be explored:
  - dslr raw, dslr, new smartphone, old smartphone
  - whithin the same camera
  - levels of image compression
  - fresh, dry dropping
  - calculation of areas using reference scale or using image metadata and sensor specs (if possible)
  - white paper, brown paper
